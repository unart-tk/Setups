What are the very first steps after the login.

1. Change your admin password

2. Create a user

3. Check/set timezone



1. Change your admin password
-----------------------------

Don't use a admin or root login for everyday work, so first give the administrator a long and secure password

    passwd


2. Create a user 

Now lets create an administrative user and  him into 'wheel' group. It defines a set of users for administrative tasks.

    sudo groupadd wheel

then edit the sudoers file with:

    sudo visudo 

and add:

    ## Group with admin rights
    %wheel ALL=(ALL)   ALL

Ok - finally - we create the user:

    sudo useradd bob

and put into 'wheel' group:

    sudo usermod -a -G wheel group


3. Check/set timezone

The last time is to set the timezone correctly. There are services that depend on that (like ntp)

Timezones are actually defined by the link '/etc/localtime' pointing in /usr/share/zoneinfo, like:
    
    ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Central /etc/localtime

But there is an nice tool to manage that, so I use:

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
