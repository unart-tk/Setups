----

1. Set Hostname

2. Set static ip

3. Set hosts file



1. Set Hostname
---------------

The hostname is the computers name, check it with:

    hostname

Backup the existing:

    sudo mv /etc/hostname{,.orig}

Give the now name 'superiron':

    echo 'superiron' | sudo tee /etc/hostname

And finish

    sudo hostname -F /etc/hostname


2. Define a static ip
---------------------

If you get your ip address from DHCP, this is how you change it static.

First, whats your current IP adress(es):

    ifconfig | grep inet 

So you can take one of those as static IP:

    sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

If you're on DHCP, it looks like:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp

Change it to:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
            address 192.168.1.39
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            network 192.168.1.0
            broadcast 192.168.1.255
            gateway 192.168.1.1


We take the simple route and make sure our DNS setting has the same address as the gateway (router):

    vim /etc/resolv.conf

    nameserver 192.168.1.1

And restart:

    sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

If there is an Error like

    unable to resolve ....

proceed to the next step



3. Internal hosts
-----------------

Lets define a few hosts in our internal network.

    sudo vim /etc/hosts

It can look like the following:

    127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost superiron

    127.0.0.1	mymachine.mylan.org mymachine
    192.168.1.40 musicserver.mylan.org mysiserver


Important: make sure, the hostname is also part of the hostsfile and point to localhost

    127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost superiron


And restart:

    sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

If there is an Error like

With these entries we can resolve the ip 192.168.1.40 internally with going through a plublic network.

4. Final tests
--------------

Can names be resolved

    ping google.com

What are the routes:

    traceroute google.com

Or even more interesting

    mtr google.com
